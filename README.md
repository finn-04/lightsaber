## visual effects
30 individually-addressible LEDs, controlled by AdaFruit's NeoPixel library. Our blade turns on and off incrementally, i.e. it "ignites" and "de-ignites" as a lightsaber would. The weilder can choose their desired blade color via a wheel on the hilt that scrolls through the color gamut of the LEDs (some numbers may have to be changed slightly to ensure that this is the ENTIRE color gamut... a work in progress).

## sound effects
The lightsaber makes the "on" and "off" sounds that a lightsaber would, and also plays a "swing" sound when it is swung.
